    <h2>Our Sheep</h2>

    <p>Rockbridge Farm is home to Black Welsh Mountain sheep and Romney sheep. Our flocks
    are raised humanely, free of hormones, and full of natural goodness.</p>

      <h3>Black Welsh Mountain Sheep</h3>
      <img src="images/black-welsh-mountain.svg" alt="Black Welsh Mountain sheep at Rockbridge Farm" class="breed-image" style="height: 260px;">
      <p>Our Black Welsh Mountain flock is one of only about fifty registered flocks in
      the country, and we are fortunate to have recently secured a new bloodline directly
      from the UK.</p>
      <p>Black Welsh Mountain Sheep are a small dual-purpose breed that provides excellent
      mild mutton and a completely black, dense, and durable fleece. They are small and
      easy to handle, and are ideal for farms where their hardiness, good mothering, and
      feed efficiency are significant assets.</p>
      <p>Rams have attractive horns that curl around their ears, while ewes are polled.
      The breed is listed as threatened by the Livestock Conservancy, making conservation
      of these beautiful animals all the more important.</p>
      <p>Three rams and 13 ewes were first imported to the United States in 1973, beginning
      the North American population. There are now approximately 1,600 in North America in
      flocks across the United States and Canada.</p>

      <h3>Romney Sheep</h3>
      <img src="images/romney.svg" alt="Romney sheep at Rockbridge Farm" class="breed-image" style="height: 260px;">
      <p>The Romney is a long-wool breed well known for its heavy and thick fleece. Traced
      back to Kent, England, the breed has adapted to varied conditions, remaining healthy
      and productive across different climates.</p>
      <p>The Romney is often described as a dual-purpose breed, producing both meat and
      wool. The muscular lambs provide good meat, and the mature sheep produce a fleece that
      is easy to spin &mdash; making it a favorite among hand spinners and fiber artists.</p>
